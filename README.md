# html-css-layout-1

Hi everyone! It is my another project - I would like to improve my HTML/CSS skills. I will try to make a modern webpage using only HTML and CSS. 

My goals are:
- using only HTML and CSS with preprocessors - done;
- preparing responsive website - done;
- writing clean, easy to read the code - I hope it is done :);
- improving my skills and learning something new :);
- checking other browsers (checked for now in Opera + Edge).

Some information the project:
- all sections are responsive - breakpoints are from https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_mediaqueries.asp;
- there's no flexbox and grid, only float if necessary - to improve the positioning skill with the float property (and it's safe in IE browsers);
- smooth scrolling is not included;
- there are 2 sliders which are working in the same way - the first contains photos and text, the second contains just text;
- images are from pixabay.com.
