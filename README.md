# html-css-layout-1

Hi everyone! It is my another project - I would like to improve my HTML/CSS skills. I will try to make a modern webpage using only HTML and CSS. 

My goals are:
- using only HTML and CSS without preprocessors
- preparing responsive website
- writing clean, easy to read the code
- improving my skills and learning something new :)
